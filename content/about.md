# 👋 **Hi there!**

I'm a creative soul 👨‍🎨 driven by passion and an unwavering commitment to my work. My journey in the IT world 💻 began five years ago as an eager *IT Support Intern*, and along the way, I’ve embraced challenges that have led me to thrive as a *Freelance Website Developer* 👨🏼‍💻, *IT Support Manager* or even *Founder* of own Foundation. I blend my technical expertise with a love for contemporary art and a steadfast dedication to non-governmental causes, always seeking ways to connect technology with a greater social purpose. 🤗

Outside the job, I channel my creativity and energy into diverse pursuits — from playing video games 👾 and exploring vibrant cityscapes 🌆 to practicing yoga 🧘🏻, and contributing to meaningful social initiatives. Each day presents a new opportunity to learn 📚, innovate 🧪, and impact lives 💕, and I am excited by the prospect of continually growing both professionally and personally.

I believe that the synergy between artistry 🎨, technology 📱, and community 👥 creates a powerful force for change 💪, and that’s the essence of who I am. I invite you to join me on this journey toward a future where creativity and purpose meet at the intersection of innovation and care. 🫶
