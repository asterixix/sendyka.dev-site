# About me

üëã Hi there! I am a creative individual, full of passion and committed to my work. I've been in the IT industry for 4 years, starting my journey as an IT Support Intern and later working as a Freelance Website Developer. My current skill set is mainly focused on IT Support and Management in small to medium-sized organizations. I have a deep passion for technology, non-governmental organizations, and contemporary art. In my leisure time, I enjoy playing video games, participating in social/probono activities, exploring different cities, running, and practicing yoga.
