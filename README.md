# Sendyka.dev Personal Site

That's project of my personal site https://sendyka.dev launched on [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) and [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) theme.

For daily hosting services I use [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) 'cause when my Student Pack goes down and Pages from Github shutted my site, firstly I migrated to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), but to clear accesses and services I decided to all things host on Cloudflare.

Feel free to check code and fork what you need it.
